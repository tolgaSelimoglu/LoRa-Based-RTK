%% RF Satellite Link
%
% This model shows a satellite link, using the blocks from the
% Communications Toolbox(TM) to simulate the following impairments:
%
% * Memoryless nonlinearity
% * Free space path loss
% * Doppler error
% * Receiver thermal noise
% * Phase noise
% * In-phase and quadrature imbalances
% * DC offsets
%
% The model optionally corrects most of these impairments.
%
% By modeling the gains and losses on the link, this model implements link
% budget calculations that determine whether a downlink can be closed with
% a given bit error rate (BER). The gain and loss blocks, including the
% Free Space Path Loss block and the Receiver Thermal Noise block,
% determine the data rate that can be supported on the link in an additive
% white Gaussian noise channel.

%% Exploring the Example
%
% Double-click the block labeled *Model Parameters* to view the parameter
% settings for the model. All these parameters are tunable. To make changes
% to the parameters as the model is running, apply them in the dialog, then
% update the model via ctrl+d. The parameters are:
%
% *Satellite altitude (km)* - Distance between the satellite and the ground
% station. Changing this parameter updates the Free Space Path Loss block.
% The default setting is 35600.
%
% *Frequency (MHz)* - Carrier frequency of the link. Changing this
% parameter updates the Free Space Path Loss block. The default setting is
% 4000.
%
% *Transmit and receive antenna diameters (m)* - The first element in the
% vector represents the transmit antenna diameter and is used to calculate
% the gain in the Tx Dish Antenna Gain block. The second element represents
% the receive antenna diameter and is used to calculate the gain in the Rx
% Dish Antenna Gain block. The default setting is [.4 .4].
%
% *Noise temperature (K)* - Allows you to select from four effective
% receiver system noise temperatures. The selected noise temperature
% changes the *Noise Temperature* of the Receiver Thermal Noise block. The
% default setting is 20 K. The choices are
%
% * |0 (no noise)| - Use this setting to view the other RF impairments
% without the perturbing effects of noise.
% * |20 (very low noise level)| - Use this setting to view how easily a low
% level of noise can, when combined with other RF impairments, degrade the
% performance of the link.
% * |290 (typical noise level)| - Use this setting to view how a typical
% quiet satellite receiver operates.
% * |500 (high noise level)| - Use this setting to view the receiver
% behavior when the system noise figure is 2.4 dB and the antenna noise
% temperature is 290K.
%
% *HPA backoff level* - Allows you to select from three backoff levels.
% This parameter is used to determine how close the satellite high power
% amplifier is driven to saturation. The selected backoff is used to set
% the input and output gain of the Memoryless Nonlinearity block. The
% default setting is 30 dB (negligible nonlinearity). The choices are
%
% * |30 dB (negligible nonlinearity)| - Sets the average input power to 30
% decibels below the input power that causes amplifier saturation (that is,
% the point at which the gain curve becomes flat). This causes negligible
% AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM conversion. AM-to-AM conversion is an indication of
% how the amplitude nonlinearity varies with the signal magnitude. AM-to-PM
% conversion is a measure of how the phase nonlinearity varies with signal
% magnitude.
% * |7 dB (moderate nonlinearity)| - Sets the average input power to 7
% decibels below the input power that causes amplifier saturation. This
% causes moderate AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM conversion, which is correctable
% with digital predistortion.
% * |1 dB (severe nonlinearity)| - Sets the average input power to 1
% decibel below the input power that causes amplifier saturation. This
% causes severe AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM conversion, and is not correctable
% with digital predistortion.
%
% *Doppler error* - Allows you to select one of two values of Doppler. The
% selection updates the Phase/Frequency Offset (Doppler Error) block. The
% default setting is |0 Hz|. The choices are
%
% * |0 Hz| - No Doppler on the link.
% * |3 Hz| - Adds 3 Hz carrier frequency offset.
%
% *Phase noise* - Allows you to select from three values of phase noise at
% the receiver. The selection updates the Phase Noise block. The default
% setting is |Negligible (-100 dBc/Hz @ 100 Hz)|. The choices are
%
% * |Negligible (-100 dBc/Hz @ 100 Hz)| - Almost no phase noise.
% * |Low (-55 dBc/Hz @ 100 Hz)| - Enough phase noise to be visible in both
% the spectral and I/Q domains, and cause bit errors when combined with
% thermal noise or other RF impairments.
% * |High (-48 dBc/Hz @ 100 Hz)| - Enough phase noise to cause errors
% without the addition of thermal noise or other RF impairments.
%
% *I/Q imbalance and DC offset* - Allows you to select from five types of
% in-phase and quadrature imbalances at the receiver. The selection updates
% the I/Q Imbalance block. The default setting is |None|. The choices are
%
% * |None| - No imbalances.
% * |Amplitude imbalance (3 dB)| - Applies a 1.5 dB gain to the in-phase
% signal and a -1.5 dB gain to the quadrature signal.
% * |Phase imbalance (20 deg)| - Rotates the in-phase signal by 10 degrees
% and the quadrature signal by -10 degrees.
% * |In-phase DC offset (1e-8)| - Adds a DC offset of 1e-8 to the in-phase
% signal amplitude. This offset changes the received signal constellation
% diagram, but does not cause errors on the link unless combined with
% thermal noise or other RF impairments.
% * |Quadrature DC offset (5e-8)| - Adds a DC offset of 5e-8 to the
% quadrature signal amplitude. This offset causes errors on the link even
% when not combined with thermal noise or another RF impairment. This
% offset also causes a DC spike in the received signal spectrum.
%
% *Digital predistortion* - Allows you to enable or disable the Digital
% Predistortion subsystem. The default setting is |Disabled|.
%
% *DC offset correction* - Allows you to enable or disable the DC Blocking
% subsystem. The default setting is |Disabled|.
%
% *Doppler correction* - Allows you to enable or disable the Doppler
% Correction subsystem. The default setting is |Disabled|.
%
% *I/Q imbalance correction* - Allows you to enable or disable the I/Q
% Imbalance Correction subsystem. The default setting is |Disabled|.

%% Results and Displays
%
% When you run this model, the following displays are active:
%
% *Power Spectrum* - Double-clicking this Open Scopes block enables you to
% view the spectrum of the modulated/filtered signal (yellow) and the
% received signal before demodulation (blue).
%

TxRx_sc.OpenAtSimulationStart = true;
sim(modelname, Tsim );

%%

TxRx_sc.OpenAtSimulationStart = false;
set_param( hpa,   'openScopeAtSimStart', 'on'  );
close_system(TxRx);

%%
%
% Comparing the two spectra allows you to view the effect of the following
% RF impairments:
%
% * Spectral regrowth due to HPA nonlinearities caused by the Memoryless
% Nonlinearity block
% * Thermal noise caused by the Receiver Thermal Noise block
% * Phase flicker (that is, 1/f noise) caused by the Phase Noise block
%
%%
%
% *HPA AM/AM and AM/PM* - Double-clicking this Open Scopes block enables
% you to view the AM/AM and AM/PM conversion after the HPA. These plots
% enable you to view the impact that the Digital Predistortion block and
% HPA have on the linearity of the signal.
%
%%
%
% *Constellation Before and After HPA* - Double-clicking this Open Scopes
% block enables you to compare the constellation of the transmitted signal
% before (yellow) and after (blue) the HPA. The amplifier gain causes the
% HPA Output signal to be larger than the HPA Input signal. This plot
% enables you to view the combined effect of both the HPA nonlinearity and
% digital predistortion.
%
hpa_sc = get_param(hpa,'ScopeConfiguration');
hpa_sc.ShowLegend = false;
sim(modelname, Tsim );


%%
set_param( hpa,   'openScopeAtSimStart', 'off'  );
set_param( rec,   'openScopeAtSimStart', 'on'  );
close_system(hpa);

%%
%
% *End to End Constellation* - Double-clicking this Open Scopes block
% enables you to compare the reference 16-QAM constellation (red) with the
% received QAM constellation before demodulation (yellow). Comparing these
% constellation diagrams allows you to view the impact of all the RF
% impairments on the received signal and the effectiveness of the
% compensations.
%
sim(modelname, Tsim );

%%
% *Bit error rate (BER) display* - In the lower right corner of the model
% is a display of the BER of the model. The BER computation can be reset
% manually by double-clicking the green "Double-click to reset BER" button.
% This allows you to view the impact of the parameter changes as the model
% is running.
%


%% Experimenting with the Example
%
% This section describes some ways that you can change the model parameters
% to experiment with the effects of the blocks from the RF Impairments
% library and other blocks in the model. You can double-click the block
% labeled "Model Parameters" in the model and try some of the following
% scenarios:
%
% *Link gains and losses* - Change *Noise temperature* to |290 (typical
% noise level)|, |0 (no noise)| or |500 (high noise level)|. Change the
% value of the *Satellite altitude (km)* or *Satellite frequency (MHz)*
% parameters to change the free space path loss. In addition, increase or
% decrease the *Transmit and receive antenna diameters (m)* parameter to
% increase or decrease the received signal power. You can view the changes
% in the received constellation in the received signal constellation
% diagram scope and the changes in received power in the spectrum analyzer.
%
% *Raised cosine pulse shaping* - Make sure *Noise temperature* is set to
% |0 (no noise)|. Turn on the Constellation Before and After HPA scopes.
% Observe that the square-root raised cosine filtering results in
% intersymbol interference (ISI). This results in the points being
% scattered loosely around ideal constellation points, which you can see in
% the After HPA constellation diagram. The square-root raised cosine filter
% in the receiver, in conjunction with the transmit filter, controls the
% ISI, which you can see in the received signal constellation diagram.
%
% *HPA AM-to-AM conversion and AM-to-PM conversion* - Change the *HPA
% backoff level* parameter to |7 dB (moderate nonlinearity)| and observe
% the AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM conversions by comparing the Transmit RRC
% filtered signal constellation diagram with the RRC signal after HPA
% constellation diagram. Note how the AM-to-AM conversion varies according
% to the different signal amplitudes. You can also view the effect of this
% conversion on the received signal in the received signal constellation
% diagram. In addition, you can observe the spectral regrowth in the
% received signal spectrum analyzer. You can also view the phase change in
% the received signal in the received signal constellation diagram scope.
%
% *Digital predistortion* With the Digital predistortion checkbox checked,
% change the *HPA backoff level* parameter to |30 dB (negligible
% nonlinearity)|, |7 dB (moderate nonlinearity)|, and |1 dB (severe
% nonlinearity)| to view the effect of digital predistortion on the HPA
% nonlinearity.
%
% *Phase noise plus AM-to-AM conversion* - Set the *Phase Noise* parameter
% to |High| and observe the increased variance in the tangential direction
% in the received signal constellation diagram. Also note that this level
% of phase noise is sufficient to cause errors in an otherwise error-free
% channel.
%
% *DC offset and DC offset compensation* - Set the *I/Q imbalance and DC
% offset* parameter to |In-phase DC offset (1e-8)| and view the shift of
% the constellation in the received signal constellation diagram. Set *DC
% offset correction* to |Enabled| and view the received signal
% constellation diagram to view how the DC offset block estimates the DC
% offset value and removes it from the signal. Set *DC offset compensation*
% to |Disabled| and change *I/Q imbalance* to |Quadrature DC offset
% (5e-8)|. View the changes in the received signal constellation diagram
% for a large DC offset and the DC spike in the received signal spectrum.
% Note that the LNA amplifies the small DC offsets so that they are visible
% on the constellation diagram with much larger axis limits. Set *DC offset
% compensation* to |Enabled| and view the received signal constellation
% diagram and spectrum analyzer to see how the DC component is removed.
%
% *Amplitude imbalance* - With the *I/Q imbalance correction* disabled, set
% the *I/Q Imbalance and DC offset* parameter to |Amplitude imbalance (3
% dB)| to view the effect of unbalanced I and Q gains in the received
% signal constellation diagram. Enable the *I/Q imbalance correction* to
% compensate for the amplitude imbalance.
%
% *Doppler and Doppler compensation* - Disable Doppler correction by
% unchecking the *Doppler correction* check box. Set *Doppler error* to |3
% Hz| to show the effect of uncorrected Doppler on the received signal
% constellation diagram. Enable *Doppler correction* to show that the
% carrier synchronizer restores the received constellation. Repeat the
% exercise with different I/Q imbalance and DC offsets.
%
